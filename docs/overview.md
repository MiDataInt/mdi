This is the documentation for the **mdi command line utility**.
It will help you execute all MDI-related tasks on a Linux server, 
including installation, management, and pipeline execution.

### Other ways to call MDI functions

The command line utility is only
used on a Linux server that will run Stage 1 Pipelines.
Here are some of the other ways MDI tools are accessed:

- MDI Desktop: <https://midataint.github.io/mdi-desktop-app>
- MDI R package: <https://midataint.github.io/mdi-manager>
- MDI public web servers: <https://github.com/MiDataInt/mdi-web-server>

In remote modes, the recommended MDI Desktop will install
and makes calls to the MDI command line utility for you, via SSH.
