This is the documentation for the **mdi command line utility**.
It will help you execute all MDI-related tasks on a Linux server, 
including installation, management, and pipeline execution.

### Other ways to call MDI functions

Most commonly, the command line utility described here is only
used on a Linux server that will run Stage 1 Pipelines.
The following are some of the other ways MDI tools are accessed:

- MDI R package: <https://github.com/MiDataInt/mdi-manager>
- MDI batch scripts: <https://wilsonte-umich.shinyapps.io/mdi-script-generator>
- MDI public web servers: <https://github.com/MiDataInt/mdi-web-server>
